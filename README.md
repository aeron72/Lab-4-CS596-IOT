## üìã Overview
This project is part of Lab 4 for CS596 - IoT Systems. It demonstrates how to build two embedded Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications using the ESP32 board:

- **Part A**: A basic BLE-controlled LED using a phone or BLE client to send "ON"/"OFF" commands.
- **Part B**: A BLE-enabled step counter that uses an LSM6DSO accelerometer to detect steps and sends the step count to a BLE client while also displaying it on a TFT screen.
